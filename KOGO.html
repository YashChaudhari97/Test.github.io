                    rating feature for a fast and easy rating process & also added CTA back to home to complete the

                    forget the password? So, as a solution, I added a forgot password button exactly near the password
                    field so users can find it easily in case of password is forgotten.</p>

                    prices were unknown, so in refining the mockup phase I added a rupee symbol before prices on all
                    screens who are including prices.</p>

                every step of the design process and the importance of each stage. Also closely experienced how
                usability studies and feedback impact design iterations. The whole designing journey developed new
                perspectives as a UX Designer.</p>
